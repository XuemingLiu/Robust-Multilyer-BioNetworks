# Robust-Multilyer-BioNetworks

The repository contains the code for generating the main results of the paper "Robustness and lethality in multilayer biological molecular networks".

It contains both Matlab-R2017a and R-3.6.1 code. The theoretical calculation of the final functional sizes in the GRN, PPI and metabolic networks are written in the Matlab, while the simulations for enrichment analysis, metabolic disease genes removal, and verification of the framework are written in R.

Note: documentation is still being prepared.
